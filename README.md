# Sudoku-Solver
My Implementation of a Sudoku Solver using Breath-First-Search (Bfs) with Foward Checking and documenting the progress as output in the console. Note that the sudokus provided in the 'test_sudoku'-directory are all valid but cannot be fed as input all at once. Provide them one at the time. The sudokus-boards are represented as a 2-dimensional list.
